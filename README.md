## Description
This project demonstrates a proof of concept (POC) to host a student records web application in the AWS Cloud. The objective is to improve the experience for users by ensuring the application is highly available, scalable, load balanced, secure, and high performing.

## Structure
The project is organized into the following structure:

1. **Application-code folder**
    - **app folder**
    - **public folder**
    - **views folder**
    - **index.js file**
    - **package-lock.json file**
    - **package.json file**
2. **Docs**
    - Images of diagrams (Phase 2 diagram, Phase 3 diagram, Phase 4-final diagram), images used in documentation.md 
    - Cost estimated file
    - Documentation file
    - Presentation file
3. **Helper Scripts**
    - Three recommended scripts to use on AWS Lab Instructions: Building a Highly Available, Scalable Web Application  (cloud9-scripts, UserdataScript-phase-2, UserdataScript-phase-3)
4. **README.md file**

## By the End of This Project, We Will Learn to:
- Create an architectural diagram to depict various AWS services and their interactions with each other.
- Estimate the cost of using services by using the AWS Pricing Calculator.
- Deploy a functional web application that runs on a single virtual machine and is backed by a relational database.
- Architect a web application to separate layers of the application, such as the web server and database.
- Create a virtual network that is configured appropriately to host a web application that is publicly accessible and secure.
- Deploy a web application with the load distributed across multiple web servers.
- Configure the appropriate network security settings for the web servers and database.
- Implement high availability and scalability in the deployed solution.
- Configure access permissions between AWS services.
